# Summer MQTT

Summer MQTT is a MQTT Client wrapper service for Spring Framework, and is intended as a flexible alternate to using Spring Integration MQTT.

## Project Description

The project is in the planning and initial development phase.

## Initial Roadmap

- Build an example Spring Boot application to show how to use the Summer MQTT wrapper service
- Create a Core package that contains commons elements and abstractions to allow for multiple future MQTT Client implementations
- Create an Eclipse Paho Java Client wrapper service using the MqttAsyncClient
